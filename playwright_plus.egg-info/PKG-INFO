# playwright_plus
The provided package code utilizes Playwright, a web automation library, to intercept JSON data from web pages. It includes utility functions like json_detect_error to identify errors within the JSON response and json_parse_result to format the JSON data into a standardized response structure. The main functions, such as intercept_json_playwright and intercept_json_playwright_multiple, use Playwright to intercept JSON responses, handle errors, and parse the data. These functions offer flexibility by allowing users to provide custom error detection and parsing logic. Additionally, there's a function request_json_playwright that simplifies the process by internally utilizing intercept_json_playwright. These functions facilitate seamless interaction with web APIs, providing a structured approach to handling JSON data retrieval and potential errors during the process.
